Task
================

Your Grandma wants you to publish her famous cookie recipe to the world wide web, she's typed it out for you in this .html document (she's so nice).

She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The cookies won't taste good if you don't get the order right. (hint you need an ordered list).

Your Grandpa happens to be a great Graphic Designer and gave you the following specs to style:

Cookie Recipe CSS
=================

- The background color for the page is #FFE
- The color for the text reading "Nutrition Information" is #887
- The link color is #900

Bonus: The border on the page and around the image is black

Like from my perspective:
- Quit Saatchi and cancel your trip to Austin
- You and I run away for a couple of days after my class tomorrow night
- Spend the next two weeks enjoying your place, relaxing and thinking about what you wanna do next
- Move out of your place and visit friends/family in the beginning of June
- Spend rest of June/July traveling, figuring out life and crashing with me
- Make it your goal to have a new job lined up in August
- You have some money saved and wouldn’t have any rent to pay…basically just food lol
- Fuck what everyone says…it is your life…live it :)
